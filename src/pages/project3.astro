A control configuration that works well for one group of patients may be less effective for others due to biological variability. This variability can be due to differences in metabolism, lifestyle, age, or even minor physiological changes. As a reuslt, the system's effectiveness may degrade over time unless it can self-adapt to these variations.
<br>
This project focuses on mining a hybrid automata (HA) representation of the system From I/O timeseries data collected from the operation of CPS. The goal is to learn personalized self-adaptive control for optimized performance of blood glucose control.
